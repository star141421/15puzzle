# 15puzzle
A multi-threading 15-puzzle solver in C++, using 8+7 disjoint pattern database and IDA*. 
To gengerate the database in multi-threads, you should have at least 1GB RAM for the program. It will cost ~20s on a 8-core mordern laptop.
The IDA* part is still single-thread, might be improved later.
